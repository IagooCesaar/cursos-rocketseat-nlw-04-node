<h1 align="center">NPS-API</h1>

<h3>Hi everyone! This is a NPS (Net Promoter Score) API, developed during a #NextLevelWeek</h3>

Next Level Week (or [#NLW](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlw?src=hashtag_click)) is a online event to introduce people to a developer's world. The NLW is produce by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

Each edition presents a different application. The 4th edition presents 3 trails: #NodeJs, #ReactJS and #Elixir. This is NodeJS trail, where we produce the NPS-API.

<h2>How it Works?</h2>

First of all, its necessary create a survey, and then, create a user. With those data, we can provide a survey for users, sended via email

See the Entity and Relationship Diagram below:

<h2>Try it yourself</h2>

Take the steps to get and execute the NPS-API:

1. First, you need to download this source code or clone with git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:IagooCesaar/cursos-rocketseat-nlw-04-node.git

// or

git clone https://github.com/IagooCesaar/cursos-rocketseat-nlw-04-node.git
```

2. If you clone this repository, you may change to directory cursos-rocketseat-nlw-04-node with `cd cursos-rocketseat-nlw-04-node` otherwise, you can do it manually

3. On the repository directory, you will need to install dependencies of this project. To do so, you can use `yarn`or `npm` on your favorite terminal, like this:

```bash
yarn install
```

4. On the package.json file, you can checkout some scripts. Here we will use just two: "dev" and "test".

- dev: will run the application in developer's mode

- test: will execute script of tests

To execute those, you can do like that:

```bash
yarn dev

// or

yarn test
```

The result should be like this examples:

- dev script result's:

  ![dev script result's](https://github.com/IagooCesaar/cursos-rocketseat-nlw-04-node/blob/main/.github/dev-script-result.jpg?raw=true)

- test script result's:

  ![test script result's](https://github.com/IagooCesaar/cursos-rocketseat-nlw-04-node/blob/main/.github/test-script-result.jpg?raw=true)

To next steps below, we need to execute `dev script`, because we will introduce the app's routes.
